# panic = "unwind" in opposite to "abort", allows to catch panic!()
# Since Czkawka parse different types of files with few libraries, it is possible
# that some files will cause crash, so at this moment I don't recommend to use "abort"
# until you are ready to occasional crashes
panic = "unwind"

# LTO setting is disabled by default, because release mode is usually needed to develop app and compilation with LTO would take a lot of time

**Czkawka** is a simple, fast, written in Rust and easy to use app to remove unnecessary files from your computer.

## Features
- Written in memory safe Rust
- Amazingly fast - due using more or less advanced algorithms and multithreading support
- Free, Open Source without ads
- CLI frontend, very fast and powerful with rich help
- GUI GTK frontend - uses modern GTK 3 and looks similar to FSlint
- Light/Dark theme match the appearance of the system(Linux only)
- Saving results to a file - allows reading entries found by the tool easily
- Rich search option - allows setting absolute included and excluded directories, set of allowed file extensions or excluded items with * wildcard
- Clean Glade file in which UI can be easily modernized
- Multiple tools to use:
  - Duplicates - Finds duplicates basing on size(fast), hash(accurate), first 1MB of hash(moderate)
  - Empty Folders - Finds empty folders with the help of advanced algorithm
  - Big Files - Finds provided number of the biggest files in given location
  - Empty Files - Looks for empty files across disk
  - Temporary Files - Allows finding temporary files
  - Similar Images - Finds images which are not exactly the same(different resolution, watermarks)
  - Zeroed Files - Find files which are filled with zeros(usually corrupted)
  - Same Music - Search for music with same artist, album etc.
  - Invalid Symbolic Links - Shows symbolic links which points to non-existent files/directories

## Requirements
If you are using Windows or Mac binaries, there is no specific requirements.  
Same with Appimage on Linux(except having system 18.04+ or similar).  
But compiled binaries on Linux or compiling it on your own os require to install this packages:
### Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install cargo libgtk-dev
```
### Fedora/CentOS
```
sudo yum install cargo gtk3-devel glib2-devel
```

## Usage
### Precompiled binaries
Precompiled binaries are available here - https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/.  
If the app does not run when clicking at a launcher, run it through a terminal.

### Appimage
Appimage files are available in release page - https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/

### Cargo
Easier method to install Czkawka is to use Cargo command(you must have installed GTK libraries in OS)
```
cargo install czkawka_gui
```
You can update package by typing same command.

### Snap
Sadly some features are not available like mounted drives
```
sudo snap install czkawka
```

### Flatpak
Maybe someday


### Debian/Ubuntu repository and PPA
Tried to set up it, but for now I have problems described in this issue

https://salsa.debian.org/rust-team/debcargo-conf/-/issues/21


### AUR - Arch Linux Package (unofficial)
Czkawka is also available in Arch Linux's AUR from which it can be easily downloaded and installed on the system.
```
yay -Syu czkawka-git
```

This is unofficial package, so new versions will not be always available.

### Devel versions
Artifacts from each commit you can also download here - https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/actions

## Compilation
### Requirements
Rust 1.46 - probably lower also works fine(1.40 is needed by GTK)  
GTK 3.22 - for GTK backend


For now only Linux (and maybe also macOS) is supported

- Install requirements for GTK
```
apt install -y libgtk-3-dev
```

### Compilation from source
- Download the source
```
git clone https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka.git
cd czkawka
```
- Run GTK GUI
```
cargo run --bin czkawka_gui
```
For Linux-to-Windows cross-building instruction look at the CI.

- Run CLI(this will print help with a lot of examples)
```
cargo run --bin czkawka_cli
```

## Benchmarks
Since Czkawka is written in Rust and aims to be a faster alternative to FSlint (written in Python), we need to compare the speed of these tools.

I tested it on SSD Disk 256GB GoodRam and i7 4770 CPU.

I prepared a directory and performed a test without any folder exceptions(I removed all directories from FSlint and Czkawka from other tabs than Include Directory) which contained 229868 files which took 203,7 GB and 13708 duplicates files in 9117 groups which took 7.90 GB.

Minimum file size to check I set to 1 KB on all programs

| App| Executing Time |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| FSlint 2.4.7 (Second Run)| 86s |
| Czkawka 1.4.0 (Second Run) | 12s |
| DupeGuru 4.0.4 (Second Run) | 28s |


I used Mprof for checking memory usage FSlint and Dupeguru, for Czkawka I used Heaptrack.
To not get Dupeguru crash I checked smaller directory with 217986 files and 41883 folders.

| App| Idle Ram | Max Operational Ram Usage | Stabilized after search |
|:----------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| FSlint 2.4.7 | 62 MB | 84 MB | 84 MB |
| Czkawka 1.4.0 | 9 MB | 66 MB | 32 MB |
| DupeGuru 4.0.4 | 80 MB | 210 MB | 155 MB |

Similar Images which check 332 files which takes 1,7GB

| App| Scan time |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Czkawka 1.4.0 | 58s |
| DupeGuru 4.0.4 | 51s |

Similar Images which check 1421 image files which takes 110,1MB

| App| Scan time |
|:----------:|:-------------:|
| Czkawka 1.4.0 | 25s |
| DupeGuru 4.0.4 | 92s |

So still is a big room for improvements.

## Contributions
Contributions to this repository are welcome.  

You can help by creating:
- Bug report - memory leaks, unexpected behavior, crashes
- Feature proposals - proposal to change/add/delete some features
- Pull Requests - implementing a new feature yourself or fixing bugs, but you have to pay attention to code quality. If the change is bigger, then it's a good idea to open a new issue to discuss changes.

The code should be clean and well formatted (Clippy and fmt are required in each PR).

The code should also be easy to read, so please use the simplest language possible without any magic numbers and variables with strange names. You should also try to write unit tests if possible.

## Name
Czkawka is a Polish word which means _hiccup_.  

I chose this name because I wanted to hear people speaking other languages pronounce it. 

This name is not as bad as it seems, because I was also thinking about using words like _żółć_, _gżegżółka_ or _żołądź_, but I gave up on these ideas because they contained Polish characters, which would cause difficulty in searching for the project.

At the beginning of the program creation, if the response concerning the name was unanimously negative, I prepared myself for a possible change of the name of the program, but the opinions were extremely mixed.

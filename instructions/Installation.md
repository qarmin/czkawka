# Installation
## Requirements
### Linux
If you use Snap, Flatpak or Appimage, you may skip this section.

For Czkawka GUI you are required to have at least `GTK 3.22` and also `Alsa` installed (for finding broken music files, but it is disabled by default).  
It should be installed by default on all the most popular distros.
#### Ubuntu/Debian
```
sudo apt install libgtk-3-dev
```
#### Fedora/CentOS
```
sudo yum install gtk3-devel glib2-devel
```
#### Void Linux (CLI only)
```
sudo xbps-install gcc pkg-config alsa-lib-devel
```

### macOS
Currently, you need to manually install `GTK 3` libraries and the Adwaita theme, because they are dynamically loaded from the OS (*we need
help in using static linking*). One very straight-forward way to do this is by using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/). Installation in the terminal:
```shell
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
brew install gtk+3 adwaita-icon-theme
```
After that, go to the location where you downloaded Czkawka and add the `executable` permission to this file.
```shell
chmod +x mac_czkawka_gui
```
At the end execute it:
```shell
./mac_czkawka_gui
```

### Windows
By default, all needed libraries are bundled with the app, inside `windows_czkawka_gui.zip`, but if you compile the app or just move `czkawka_gui.exe`, then you will need to install the `GTK 3`
runtime from [**here**](https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases).

## Installation
### Precompiled binaries
Ready-to-go executables for Linux, Windows and macOS are available [**here**](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/).  
If the app does not run when clicking the launcher, run it through a terminal.  
You don't need to have any additional libraries for CLI Czkawka.

### Nightly Builds
Artifacts from each commit can be downloaded [**here**](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/actions)

### Appimage
Appimage files are available in release page - [**GitHub releases**](https://github.com/qarmin/czkawka/releases/)  
This version is bundled with its own theme.  
There is also a small problem with not being able to open 2 images at once.

### Cargo
The easiest method to install Czkawka is using the `cargo` command. To compile it, you need to get all the
requirements from the [compilation section](Compilation.md).
```
cargo install czkawka_gui
cargo install czkawka_cli
```
You can update the package with the same command.

### Snap
```
sudo snap install czkawka
```
By default, Snap can only access the files in your home directory. You have to allow czkawka access to all the drives:

```
sudo snap connect czkawka:removable-media
```

The Snap store entry can be found [**here**](https://snapcraft.io/czkawka).

Fresh builds are available in edge branch, but they may be a little unstable, although that happens very rarely
because I don't push untested code.

### Flatpak
```
flatpak install flathub com.github.qarmin.czkawka
```
Flathub page with Czkawka can be found [**here**](https://flathub.org/apps/details/com.github.qarmin.czkawka)

# Translations

Czkawka/Krokiet is available in around 20 languages. The main (default) language is English, and Polish is also officially supported.

The application uses simple Fluent localization system: https://projectfluent.org/

Most translations are managed on Crowdin: https://crowdin.com/project/czkawka

If you want to translate Czkawka into your language, you can do so on that platform.

With each new release, many strings are added or modified. Because most of languages lack dedicated translators, parts of the translations are generated using Crowdin’s machine translation system or local LLM models. These translations may not be perfect and still require human review, but they significantly reduce the amount of work needed from human translators.

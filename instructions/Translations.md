# Translations

From all ~20 languages available in Czkawka/Krokiet, the main/default one language is English, but also Polish is officially supported.

App use Fluent localization system - https://projectfluent.org/

Translating is mostly done by site - https://crowdin.com/project/czkawka

If you want to translate Czkawka to your language, you can do it in this site.

With every new release, a lot of strings are added/changed, so due lack of dedicated translators for some languages, some strings are translated with crowdin machine translation system and some, with local llm models, so it may not be perfect and still needs human review - but this greatly reduces the amount of work needed from human translators.

**Bug Description**


**Steps to reproduce:**
<!-- Please describe what you expected to see and what you saw instead. Also include screenshots or screencasts if needed. -->


**Terminal output** (optional):
```
<!--
Add terminal output only if needed - if there are some errors or warnings or you have performance/freeze issues.  
Very helpful in this situation will be logs from czkawka run with RUST_LOG environment variable set e.g. 
`RUST_LOG=debug ./czkawka` or `flatpak run --env=RUST_LOG=debug com.github.qarmin.czkawka` if you use flatpak, which will print more detailed info about executed function.

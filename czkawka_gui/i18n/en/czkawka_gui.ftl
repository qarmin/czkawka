music_compare_only_in_title_group = Compare only in title
music_compare_only_in_title_group_tooltip =
        When enabled, files are grouped by title and then compared to each other.

        With 10000 files, instead almost 100 million comparisons usually there will be around 20000 comparisons.

same_music_tooltip =
        Searching for similar music files by its content can be configured by setting:

        - The minimum fragment time after which music files can be identified as similar
        - The maximum difference difference between two tested fragments

        The key to good results is to find sensible combinations of these parameters, for provided.

        Setting the minimum time to 5s and the maximum difference to 1.0, will look for almost identical fragments in the files.
        A time of 20s and a maximum difference of 6.0, on the other hand, works well for finding remixes/live versions etc.

        By default, each music file is compared to each other and this can take a lot of time when testing many files, so it is usually better to use reference folders and specifying which files are to be compared with each other(with same amount of files, comparing fingerprints will be faster at least 4x than without reference folders).

music_comparison_checkbox_tooltip =
        It searches for similar music files using AI, which uses machine learning to remove parentheses from a phrase. For example, with this option enabled, the files in question will be considered duplicates:
        
        Świędziżłób     ---     Świędziżłób (Remix Lato 2021)

duplicate_case_sensitive_name = Case Sensitive
duplicate_case_sensitive_name_tooltip =
        When enabled, group only records when they have exactly same name e.g. Żołd <-> Żołd

        Disabling such option will group names without checking if each letter is same size e.g. żoŁD <-> Żołd

duplicate_mode_name_combo_box = Name
duplicate_mode_size_combo_box = Size
duplicate_mode_hash_combo_box = Hash

duplicate_hash_type_tooltip = 
        Czkawka offers 3 types of hashes:

        Blake3 - cryptographic hash function. This is the default because it is very fast.

        CRC32 - simple hash function. This should be faster than Blake3, but may very rarely have some collisions.

        XXH3 - very similar in performance and hash quality to Blake3 (but non-cryptographic). So, such modes can be easily interchanged.

duplicate_check_method_tooltip = 
        For now, Czkawka offers three types of method to find duplicates by:

        Name - Finds files which have the same name.

        Size - Finds files which have the same size.

        Hash - Finds files which have the same content. This mode hashes the file and later compares this hash to find duplicates. This mode is the safest way to find duplicates. App heavily uses cache, so second and further scans of the same data should be a lot of faster than the first. 

image_hash_size_tooltip =
        Each checked image produces a special hash which can be compared with each other, and a small difference between them means that these images are similar.

        8 hash size is quite good to find images that are only a little similar to original. With a bigger set of images (>1000), this will produce a big amount of false positives, so I recommend to use  a bigger hash size in this case.

        16 is the default hash size which is quite a good compromise between finding even a little similar images and having only a small amount of hash collisions.

        32 and 64 hashes find only very similar images, but should have almost no false positives (maybe except some images with alpha channel).

image_resize_filter_tooltip = 
        To compute hash of image, the library must first resize it.

        Depend on chosen algorithm, the resulting image used to calculate hash will looks a little different.

        The fastest algorithm to use, but also the one which gives the worst results, is Nearest. It is enabled by default, because with 16x16 hash size lower quality it is not really visible.

        With 8x8 hash size it is recommended to use a different algorithm than Nearest, to have better groups of images.

image_hash_alg_tooltip = 
        Users can choose from one of many algorithms of calculating the hash.

        Each has both strong and weaker points and will sometimes give better and sometimes worse results for different images.

        So, to determine the best one for you, manual testing is required.

        Usage example  ".exe, IMAGE, VIDEO, .rar, 7z" - this means that images (e.g. jpg, png), videos (e.g. avi, mp4), exe, rar, and 7z files will be scanned.

upper_excluded_extensions_tooltip =
        List of disabled files which will be ignored in scan.

        When using both allowed and disabled extensions, this one has higher priority, so file will not be checked.

        When disabled /home/* finds both /HoMe/roman and /home/roman.

popover_custom_not_all_check_button_tooltip = 
        Prevents selecting all records in group.

        This is enabled by default, because in most situations, you don't want to delete both original and duplicates files, but want to leave at least one file.

        Using gtk previews will sometimes be faster and support more formats, but sometimes this could be exactly the opposite.

        If you have problems with loading previews, you may can to try to change this setting.

        On non-linux systems, it is recommended to use this option, because gtk-pixbuf are not always available there so disabling this option will not load previews of some images.

settings_label_restart = You need to restart app to apply settings!

settings_ignore_other_filesystems = Ignore other filesystems (only Linux)
settings_ignore_other_filesystems_tooltip =
        ignores files that are not in the same file system as searched directories.

settings_multiple_delete_outdated_cache_checkbutton = Delete outdated cache entries automatically
settings_multiple_delete_outdated_cache_checkbutton_tooltip = 
        Delete outdated cache results which point to non-existent files.

        When enabled, app makes sure when loading records, that all records point to valid files (broken ones are ignored).

        Disabling this will help when scanning files on external drives, so cache entries about them will not be purged in the next scan.

        In the case of having hundred of thousands records in cache, it is suggested to enable this, which will speedup cache loading/saving at start/end of the scan.

## Multiple - settings used in multiple tabs
settings_multiple_image_preview_checkbutton_tooltip = Shows preview at right side (when selecting an image file).
settings_multiple_image_preview_checkbutton = Show image preview

settings_multiple_clear_cache_button_tooltip = 
        Manually clear the cache of outdated entries.
        This should only be used if automatic clearing has been disabled.

settings_multiple_clear_cache_button = Remove outdated results from cache.

## Duplicates
settings_duplicates_hide_hard_link_button_tooltip = 
        Hides all files except one, if all point to the same data (are hardlinked).

        Example: In the case where there are (on disk) seven files which are hardlinked to specific data and one different file with same data but a different inode, then in duplicate finder, only one unique file and one file from hardlinked ones will be shown.

settings_duplicates_minimal_size_entry_tooltip = 
        Set the minimal file size which will be cached.

        Choosing a smaller value will generate more records. This will speedup search, but slowdown cache loading/saving.

settings_duplicates_prehash_checkbutton_tooltip = 
        Enables caching of prehash (a hash computed from a small part of the file) which allows earlier dismissal of non-duplicated results.

        It is disabled by default because it can cause slowdowns in some situations.

        It is highly recommended to use it when scanning hundred of thousands or million files, because it can speedup search by multiple times.

settings_duplicates_prehash_minimal_entry_tooltip = Minimal size of cached entry.

settings_duplicates_hide_hard_link_button = Hide hard links (only Linux and macOS)
settings_duplicates_prehash_checkbutton = Use prehash cache

settings_reset_button = Reset configuration

## Opening cache/config folders
settings_folder_cache_open_tooltip = 
        Opens the folder where the cache txt files are stored.

        Modifying the cache files may cause invalid results to be shown. However, modifying path may save time when moving a big amount of files to a different location.

        You can copy these files between computers to save time on scanning again for files (of course if they have similar directory structure).

        In the case of problems with the cache, these files can be removed. The app will automatically regenerate them.

settings_folder_settings_open_tooltip = 
        Opens the folder where the Czkawka config is stored.

        WARNING: Manually modifying the config may break your workflow.
